## 💧 Underground Water Conservation System – Wireless IoT Solution

This repository showcases a wireless, real-time underground water conservation system developed using ESP32, MQTTP, and Node-RED, aimed at optimizing water usage and monitoring flow patterns in public and private networks. Designed with scalability in mind, this solution can be adopted by government agencies for smart water distribution and conservation initiatives.

### 🛠️ Technologies & Hardware Used
- ESP32 Microcontroller – for sensor interfacing and edge-level computation
- MQTT Protocol – efficient device-to-server communication (lightweight communication between devices and visualization platform)
- Node-RED – intuitive, web-based dashboards for live monitoring
- Flow Sensors – track usage with precision
- LCD Display – user feedback with status updates
- Timeout Logic – automated control based on payment and usage patterns

### 🔑 Features
- 📶 Wireless Communication using MQTT for efficient data flow
- 📊 Real-time dashboard shows flow rate, total usage, and activity status
- ⏱️ Smart timeout mechanism ensures fair usage and automatic reset
- 💸 Optional QR-based payment interface for controlled access
- 🌐 Easily deployable in smart cities and community-level water systems

### 🌍 Social & Government Impact
- Helps reduce water wastage and enables transparent usage tracking
- Designed for scalable public deployment in rural and urban areas
- Supports government-led initiatives on resource optimization, digitized monitoring, and smart utility infrastructure
